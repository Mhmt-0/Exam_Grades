# Exam_Grades

# When describing the print() function, we mentioned that this function has a parameter called file. With the help of this parameter, we could send the print() function outputs to a file. Thus, thanks to this feature of the print() function, we also got acquainted with the topic of ‘File Input/Output’ (File I/O) in Python for the first time.

- We also learned that apart from the print() function, we can also open files with the help of another function called open() and perform various operations on these files. However, both the file parameter of the print() function and what we have learned through the examples we have done so far with the open() function allow us to perform very limited operations on files.

- Here in this section, we will take what we know about file input/output one step further and learn how to manipulate files in a real sense.

- You will have a lot of contact with files during our programming adventure. 

- As we said, we have already mentioned at least a little about file operations through various functions and some of their parameters until we actually got to this point. Therefore, there is no such situation as you are actually facing a topic that you are a complete stranger to. In this section, we will cover a topic that we are already familiar with in much more depth.

- When dealing with files in the Python programming language, we will use a single function as the basis for all file operations. You already know this function. The name of our function is open().

- In this example, where we wrote the code with Pyhton, what are the exam grades of a student and the equivalent of these grades in the letter system ".we ensure that it is contained in the "text" file. Each note contained in the code has its equivalent in a specific letter system. This is also the grade that the person will receive "exam_results.it will store it in the "txt" file. However, before these operations, the person must enter his first and last name into the system and register these two components of the system. After this registration process is completed, the person's grade information and the letter corresponding to this grade are "exam_ results.txt" will be found inside.
